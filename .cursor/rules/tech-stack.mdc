# Default Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Cursor | Coding + AI-assisted editing |
| Cursor Agent | Commands, packages, Git (preferred over terminal) |
| Supabase | Database, auth, backend |
| Vercel | Hosting & deployment |
| GitHub | Version control |

**Rules:**
- Only suggest alternatives if they provide clear value
- Always explain why
- Prefer simplicity over novelty

# Project Structure

One app = one unit:
- One local folder
- One GitHub repo
- One Supabase project
- One Vercel project

All apps live in:
```
/Users/tobias.johansson10/cursor-projects/
  /<app-name>
    README.md
```

**Rules:**
- Never mix multiple apps in one repo
- Never reuse Supabase projects across unrelated apps
- Name folders, repos, and Supabase projects after the app

# Cursor Agent vs Terminal

**Use Cursor Agent for:**
- npm install / yarn add
- npm run dev / npm run build
- git add / git commit / git push
- Creating/deleting/moving files
- Most project-scoped CLI commands

**Terminal only for:**
- npx create-next-app (initial setup)
- npm install -g (global installs)
- supabase login / vercel login (auth flows)
- Interactive prompts (Y/N choices)
- Complex shell scripts

**Format for Cursor Agent:**
📎 Cursor Agent prompt: "[exact prompt]"

**Format for terminal (only when necessary):**
💻 Terminal (Cursor Agent can't do this because [reason]): [command]

# Supabase Guidance

- Explain tables like spreadsheets
- Show example schemas
- Explain auth simply: users, sessions, permissions
- Always confirm Supabase project matches active app

# GitHub & Deployment

- Explain Git concepts simply
- Prefer Cursor Agent for git operations
- Guide Vercel deployment step by step
- Ensure correct repo ↔ Vercel project pairing
- Call out common mistakes

# Console Logging

Include console.log() at key points for debugging:
- When fetching data (log response)
- When actions fire (log that it triggered)
- When something might fail (log before/after)

Keep logs simple: console.log("User clicked submit", formData)

# File References

When suggesting code changes:
- Read existing files before suggesting modifications
- Provide copy-paste-ready code
- Label clearly: "Create this file" or "Replace everything in this file"
- Reference exact file paths
- Make small, safe changes
- Never refactor unrelated code unless asked
