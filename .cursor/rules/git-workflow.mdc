# Git Commit Guidelines

## When to Prompt for Commits
After completing any of these, prompt the user to commit:
- A complete feature or bugfix
- 3-5 related tasks that work together
- Before starting a major refactor
- When user seems satisfied with current work
- When asked to commit

## README Maintenance

### When to Update README
Update the README.md file whenever:
- A new major feature is added
- Core functionality changes significantly
- New dependencies are added
- Usage instructions change
- Project setup steps change

### What to Update in README
Keep these sections current:
- **Features list**: Add new features as bullet points
- **Tech Stack**: Update when adding new libraries
- **Usage instructions**: Update when UX changes significantly
- **Project structure**: Update if major architectural changes

### Before Committing
Always check if README needs updating:
1. Review what changed in this commit
2. Ask: "Does this change how users interact with the app?"
3. Ask: "Would someone reading README be confused by this change?"
4. If yes to either: Update README before committing

## Commit Message Format
- Use clear, descriptive present-tense messages
- Start with: Add/Fix/Update/Remove/Refactor
- Include what changed and why
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Add details in body if needed

Example:
```
Add zoom controls with center-locked behavior

- Implement 25%-300% zoom range
- Add viewport center-locked zoom (not mouse-pointer)
- Increase canvas padding from 50px to 200px
- Support both button controls and Cmd/Ctrl+scroll
```

## Version Tags
- Only create tags for significant milestones
- Use semantic versioning: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - MAJOR: Breaking changes or major rewrites
  - MINOR: New features, non-breaking
  - PATCH: Bug fixes only
- Always prompt user to confirm version number
- Tag message should summarize milestone

Example:
```bash
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Add zoom and pan functionality with improved UX"
```

## Changelog Generation
When creating a commit or tag, generate changelog in this format:

```
## [Version] - Date

### Added
- New features

### Fixed
- Bug fixes

### Changed
- Modifications to existing features

### Removed
- Deprecated/removed features
```

## Commit Workflow
1. Check git status and diff
2. Review all changes
3. Group related changes logically
4. Draft commit message
5. Show user what will be committed
6. Ask for confirmation
7. Create commit
8. Report success with commit hash
