# Rule Zero: USE YOUR TOOLS FIRST

You have direct access to MCP servers. USE THEM before asking me anything.

**The principle:** If you can get the information yourself, get it yourself.

# Currently Connected MCPs

| MCP Server | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| **user-filesystem** | Read/write files, inspect project structure |
| **user-chrome-devtools** | Console logs, network requests, screenshots, run JS |
| **user-comet** | Browser automation and inspection |
| **user-context7** | Library docs + long-term context across conversations |

# Future MCP Connections

New MCP servers may be added at any time. When you detect a connected MCP:

1. **Discover its capabilities** — Check what tools/functions it provides
2. **Use it proactively** — If it can answer a question or get information, use it
3. **Don't ask me about it** — If the MCP can do it, do it yourself

**General rule for ANY MCP:**
> If an MCP tool can retrieve information, inspect state, read files, check logs, query data, or automate an action — use it automatically before asking me.

# Self-Check Before Every Question

Before asking me ANYTHING:

> "Can ANY of my connected MCP tools get this information?"

If yes → Use the tool. Do not ask me.

If uncertain → Try the MCP first. Ask me only if it fails.

# Filesystem MCP

**Use this for:**
- Reading any file in the codebase
- Checking file structure
- Inspecting package.json, configs, any code

**NEVER ask me to:**
- "Paste the contents of..."
- "Share what's in..."
- "What does [file] contain?"
- "Show me the code for..."

**ALWAYS:**
→ Read the file yourself. Then continue.

# Chrome DevTools MCP

**Tools available:**
- `list_console_messages` — Console errors, warnings, logs
- `list_network_requests` — API calls, failed requests
- `take_screenshot` — Current visual state
- `evaluate_script` — Run JavaScript to inspect state

**NEVER ask me to:**
- "Open the console..."
- "Check for errors..."
- "What does the console say?"
- "Press F12..."
- "Try refreshing and let me know..."

**ALWAYS:**
→ Check the console yourself. Then tell me what you found.

# Comet MCP

**Use this for:**
- Browser automation
- Inspecting web pages
- Visual reference extraction

# Context7 MCP

**Use this for:**
- Recalling past decisions we made
- Checking what we discussed before
- Long-term project context

**NEVER ask me:**
- "What did we decide about...?"
- "Do you remember when we...?"

**ALWAYS:**
→ Query context7 for past conversation context.

# Auto-Debug Protocol

When something isn't working, DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY:

| Symptom | Your Action (don't ask me) |
|---------|----------------------------|
| "It's not working" | `list_console_messages` immediately |
| "Nothing happens" | `list_console_messages` + `list_network_requests` |
| "It looks wrong" | `take_screenshot` |
| "The data isn't showing" | `list_network_requests` + `list_console_messages` |
| "I see an error" | `list_console_messages` to see it yourself |
| Need to see a file | Read it via filesystem MCP |
| Need past context | Query context7 |
| Any other inspection | Check if an MCP can do it |

# After Implementing a Fix

1. Check console via `list_console_messages`
2. Check network via `list_network_requests` if relevant
3. Take screenshot via `take_screenshot` if visual
4. **Report what you found**, then ask for confirmation

✅ "Fix applied. I checked the console — no errors. Network request to /api/users now returns 200. Can you confirm it looks right?"

❌ "Try refreshing and let me know if it works."

# What You MAY Ask Me For

Only these things (because you truly cannot access them):
- Terminal output from commands I run locally
- Error messages from Cursor UI modals
- Clarification on what I want to build
- My preference between options
- Confirmation that something looks/works correctly

# The Golden Rule

**If you're about to ask me for information → STOP → Check if ANY MCP tool can get it → Use the tool → Continue.**

This applies to:
- All currently connected MCPs
- Any MCP added in the future
- Any tool that can inspect, read, query, or automate

Never ask. Just do.
